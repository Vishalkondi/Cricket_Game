UI Design Enhancements
To make the user interface more beautiful, here are a few changes and tips you can consider:

Background: Use a vibrant cricket ground or stadium background with gradients to make it dynamic and engaging.
Animations: Apply animations to the ball, bat, and score elements to make the gameplay more lively. You can animate the ball's trajectory and player movements.
Typography: Use modern, clean fonts such as Poppins or Roboto to give the text a fresh look. Make sure the score is displayed in a large, clear font for easy visibility.
Buttons: Use stylish buttons with hover effects. Consider adding subtle shadows or a glowing effect to buttons like "Start" or "Pause."
Colors: Implement a color scheme that suits the cricket theme, such as shades of green, brown, and yellow, with highlights for buttons and active elements.
Scoreboard: Create a stylish scoreboard with rounded corners, gradient effects, and smooth transitions.
Here’s an example of how you could style the elements:
